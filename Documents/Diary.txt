I put in the terrain. Its nice its basic but its a world we can walk around in.
I am not happy about the third person camera and the inventory system needs improvement on picking up items and droping items
(currently you can drop items by dragging an item to the bottom of the inventory menu only the sides wont work)
Assets are an issue. we need to get assets that will be used in the final project so a character (preferably customiseable)
the wolf form, buildings, food, animals, NPCs (could be randomised using some sort of character creator?) and terrain textures
(the terrain textures arent too bad but could be better). I made the swap camera button a public variable so now its currently
set to 'Q' but we can change this to whatever if we want very easily (Im very happy with that script)

My current goal is to create the most basic verision of our game and build from that so things like the map are NOT going to stay but gives us
an idea of what we can and cannot do.

I am going at the timmer next

UPDATE

I have the day and night cycle implemented I must just add the moon and stars for the night portion of the game
